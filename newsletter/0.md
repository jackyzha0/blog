Hi there and thanks for signing up for my newsletter!

I’ll try to keep these in a rough 3-2-1 fashion in each issue, with 3 things I’ve found interesting from others, 2 things I’ve been wondering about, and 1 thing I’ve done.

## 3 things I’ve found interesting

1. Found out about [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html), a tag-team of two people sailing around the world making open-source software
2. OpenAIs recent work with [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). Some really revolutionary stuff in combining text and image domains.
3. Vlogbrothers on [How To Change What you Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salgtCpST3A). Interesting video on how content we consume steers our wants and what we want to want affects our actual wants. Hank says it in a way that makes a lot more sense so give it a watch.

## 2 things I’ve been wondering about

1. Why didn’t I start writing earlier? Writing has always been a way to help me organize my own thoughts. Now that I’ve started writing more frequently, I feel like I’m able to better put the jumble of thoughts inside my brain onto paper (or I guess a Markdown file in this case).
2. Promoting healthier hacking culture. Conversation inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahbdhsn/status/1347666496718213120). What can we do as hackathon organizers to make events less stressful/hypercompetitive for attendees (especially those who are differently-abled)?

## 1 thing I’ve done

I wrote a [reflection piece about my 2020](https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/2020-an-imperfect-palindrome) as well as set some goals for the upcoming year! A few interesting tidbits on paratelic vs telic goal setting.
