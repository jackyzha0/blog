What first comes to your head when you think of the word 'hackathon'? Is it a 24-hour long, no-sleep, caffeine-fueled, build-fest in a big sweaty gym?

As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time. By setting a precedence of requiring hackers to already have insane amounts of pre-requisite knowledge and to stay up the entire event, it discourages new hackers — the very original target audience — from attending.

This year, I was responsible for leading logistics at our beginner-focused hackathon called HackCamp. To recentre hackathons around learning and to rebuild a healthier hacker culture, we decided to restructure our event into a virtual conference weekend, with a focus on learning and workshops on the first day, and building and hacking on the second day. This allows hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on precious hacking time, to have actual scheduled sleeping time, and to place emphasis on submitting projects rather than winning. We were able to reach over 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ live stream viewers, and over $1200 in donations to charities, and the feedback we got was absolutely stellar. I'm really excited that I got to help bring this vision for a new hackathon format to life.

In 2021, I hope to open a dialogue with other hackathon organizers from around the world to see how we can help hackathons be what they were designed to be: a friendly environment for radical ideas and rapid learning for all people.

Design Justice
---
* How do we apply design justice principles to create inclusive design sites?

### hackathons becoming very corporate
* traces the cooptation of hacker culture by neoliberalism
    * what is neoliberalism -> basically let the market decide everything
* "For example, consider the transformation of agriculture from Indigenous knowledge of small-scale planting, harvesting, and land-management techniques to modern agribusiness with monocultures, pesticides, fertilizers, and roboticized megafarms"
* hackerspaces were described as originally being "third spaces" outside of the logic of both the communist state and the capitalist market
* "at the same time, without intentional intervention, these spaces find it very difficult to fulfill even their own liberal democratic rhetoric, because they end up dominated by white cis men and by middle-class people with free time and disposable income"
    * they [hackathons] are understood by corporate managers as potentially effectives ways to identify new talent, and therefore as a possible mechanism in the tech sector hiring pipeline
    * hackathons provide excellent opportunities for the extraction of free labour
    * the assumption that a "hackathon for good" will be successful if it produces a new app the can help "solve a social problem runs deep"
    * they nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing community assets; and people think hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve big or even little problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy

### urban design
* "through such initiatives, city administrators signal that the public is invited to participate in decisionmaking on an ongoing basis, not only at the ballot box every few years" -> in response to city government being more transparent, more administrative data being made available to the public, and administrators actively seeking ideas from engaged publics about how to improve government services and city resident's quality of life
* neoliberal, technocentric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimized have become increasingly prominent
    * citizens should not be reduced to users through the lens of neoliberal governmentality


### diversity and inclusivity
*  broader availability of digital design and fabrication increases the opportunity for community-controlled design processes that include more diverse users and user stories, with more equitable and inclusive distribution of affordances
* the assumption that making sites "open" makes them inclusive, without specifically addressing race, class, gender, and/or disability dynamics, is common to many privileged design sites
* such hackathons [more inclusive hackathons] push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety
* for example, this means that it is important to consider food, bio beaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting
* hackathon spaces cultivate a culture that marginalizes hackers with specific needs, including but not limited to women, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds, and even individuals with specific dietary restrictions

### maintenance > creation
* commons-based peer production -> "decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; based on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands"
* the cult of the new and shiny drowns out the quiet call of the well established, and no one wants to solve the bugs in the old thing that already does the new thing is supposed to do
* for one, under patriarchy, making something "new" is valued more and is better rewarded than caretaking, maintaining, or supporting something "old." also, starting a new thing is fun; for many, it feels more creative than working on the nuts and bolts of an existing project
* contributing to an existing project requires contacting and negotiating with the existing developers, maintainers, and community. creating something new produces attribution, credit, and visiblity for its developers, whereas attribution, credit, and visibility for participating in an existing project must, at the very least, be shared

### hacking the hackathon
* "a one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues... you can't just come up with an app that solve the world's problems"
* they [hackathons] are often crucibles of intense and focused learning, making, problem-solving, community building, and play
* if well-organized, hackathons can provide an introduction to the use of tech for social justice, as well as pathways to employment
* many feel that focused pop-ups, hackathons, and hack nights can be valuable if they respond to the real needs of organizations with a lot of domain expertise, instead of focusing on ideas that come from coders
* "in the old days, people used to form teams and rush in and try to fix things, without really even knowing what was broken... it is no longer just a bunch of programmers in a room. there are now hackathons where actual community members are learning to code and interacting ... community members are also teaching programmers about the things they need to sustain and build for the future. that's a really good thing happening"
