What first comes to your head when you think of the word 'hackathon'? Is it a 24-hour long, no-sleep, caffeine-fueled, build-fest in a big sweaty gym?

As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time. By setting a precedence of requiring hackers to already have insane amounts of pre-requisite knowledge and to stay up the entire event, it discourages new hackers — the very original target audience — from attending.

This year, I was responsible for leading logistics at our beginner-focused hackathon called HackCamp. To recentre hackathons around learning and to rebuild a healthier hacker culture, we decided to restructure our event into a virtual conference weekend, with a focus on learning and workshops on the first day, and building and hacking on the second day. This allows hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on precious hacking time, to have actual scheduled sleeping time, and to place emphasis on submitting projects rather than winning. We were able to reach over 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ live stream viewers, and over $1200 in donations to charities, and the feedback we got was absolutely stellar. I'm really excited that I got to help bring this vision for a new hackathon format to life.

In 2021, I hope to open a dialogue with other hackathon organizers from around the world to see how we can help hackathons be what they were designed to be: a friendly environment for radical ideas and rapid learning for all people.
