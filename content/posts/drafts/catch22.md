If a pilot is deemed insane, they don't have to fly.
To be deemed insane, a pilot must request to be evaluated.
If a pilot requests to be evaluated, this demonstrates that he must be sane.
Therefore, no pilot can ever be deemed insane, and no pilot can get out of flying.
paradoxical sitauation -> catch-22

no way to win
double bind -> a psychological predicament in which a person receives from a single source conflicting messages that allow no appropriate response to be made


Collingridge dilemma -> efforts to influence or control the further development of technology face a double-bind problem
An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
A power problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.

The "pacing problem" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in Larry Downes' 2009 book The Laws of Disruption, in which he famously states that "technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally".
