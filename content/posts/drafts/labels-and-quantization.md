"Accuracy is more useful in entry-level jobs and for novices, because as skill increases, quantification of skill becomes harder."

"This is because feedback loops which are too short for the overall system makes people focus on inappropriate intermediate goals."
* dangers of intermediate proxies?
* what about in machine learning? using certain quantities for metrics which are just *proxies* for more difficult to measure qualitative end goals

"Focusing on tight feedback also leads to getting stuck in local maxima. The short turnaround time leads to the pursuit of incremental improvements. Accurate feedback reduces error, but this means reaching and staying at the local maximum. The more accurate and more rapid the loop, the more quickly you’ll arrive at the top of the hill – and the less chance you have of leaving it to climb the mountains of mastery."

"When quantifying things, people naturally focus on things that can easily be measured. Measuring the final result doesn’t provide enough quantitative data, so it’s tempting to include the data from intermediate steps. This is an attempt to shorten the feedback loop, and trying to shorten feedback loops is very dangerous in complex systems."

Are labels helpful in 

In a data-driven world, can we and should we try to quantize everything? What about inherently human qualities like emotions or personality?

some metrics that are inherently v difficult to quantize (e.g. quality of engagement) and others that are more easy to quantize and thus optimize for (like engagement)
