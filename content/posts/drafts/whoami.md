when I hop on a call with new people and they ask me to give a short intro about myself, I never know what to say. Surely, I've done *something* of note that would be relevant to the conversation? I realized I don't have a cohesive and self-consistent understanding of who I am or what I stand for.

I don't necessarily need to, but I think it'll give me a better handle on being able to pare down responsibilities and reclaim time to just rediscover what I love doing.

more of an internal exploration into what questions do I want to answer?

what i know for sure:
* i love building things and shipping them to the world
* i love communities that lift each other up and inspire each other

## how can we build support systems and communities for the next generation of builders?
* software infra and tooling
* lowering barrier of entry


I'm interested in how we can use infrastructure to build support systems. Software infrastructure is immensely important in creating the very foundation of all of the technology we use today. But, software isn't the only kind of infrastructure. I'm also a big advocate for building community infrastructure to best support the next generation of makers, builders, and change-makers and thinking about how we can leverage the modern internet to build these communities.

## how can we better understand the tools we build?

I'm interested in how we study cognitive systems to understand the implications of the tech we build. In a world increasingly dominated by AI, we have yet to seriously interrogate what it means for existing cognitive systems (i.e. us). How can we best replicate human intelligence in machines? Should we even? If we do it, how can we best create interfaces between artificial and biological intelligence?

## how can we make sure our tools benefit everyone rather than a select few?

I'm interested in how we can use ethical tech as a framework to ensure the systems we build help the people they're intended to help. Machine intelligence will become almost integral to our lives, becoming less visible in the process, and AIâ€™s bias bug will get harder to beat. How do we ensure that AI can cater to more than just that select group of people who are western, educated, and rich?
