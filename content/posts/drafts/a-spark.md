not an explanation post

more of an internal exploration into why I'm interested in the things I'm interested in

finding meaning in small things

Technology isn't inherently good or bad. Rather, it's a multiplicative tool. It can change the lives of billions for the better, or it can also propel some of our worst biases as humans.

I'm interested in how we can use infrastructure to build support systems. Software infrastructure is immensely important in creating the very foundation of all of the technology we use today. But, software isn't the only kind of infrastructure. I'm also a big advocate for building community infrastructure to best support the next generation of makers, builders, and change-makers and thinking about how we can leverage the modern internet to build these communities.

"i may not have been fully able to join when i was in high school but hey i can at least be the person i wish i had when i was there"

I'm interested in how we study cognitive systems to understand the implications of the tech we build. In a world increasingly dominated by AI, we have yet to seriously interrogate what it means for existing cognitive systems (i.e. us). How can we best replicate human intelligence in machines? Should we even? If we do it, how can we best create interfaces between artificial and biological intelligence?

I'm interested in how we can use ethical tech as a framework to ensure the systems we build help the people they're intended to help. Machine intelligence will become almost integral to our lives, becoming less visible in the process, and AIâ€™s bias bug will get harder to beat. How do we ensure that AI can cater to more than just that select group of people who are western, educated, and rich?

I believe that these will be the key pillars to how technology will operate in the coming decades and I hope to continue to learn about each so that I can interrogate and contribute meaningfully to it.
