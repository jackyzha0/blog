## what's in the frame
In which Hank talks about the metaphorical ‘frame’, or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what’s actually going on outside the frame. If all we ever see are other people’s frames, how do we remind ourselves of what’s going on outside of it and normalize being ‘out-of-frame’?

## context collapse

i think this is super interesting because i see all social media presences are flavors of the "authentic self"
so if you have someone on all of them the common denominator is who they are (limitd=ed but true0
and the same goes for seeing the same person in different social contexts
what are they like with family, friends, in competiiont
using that as a guiding point for getting to know people is nice

hmm, maybe not different flavours but different 'frames' or subsets of the same person

i dont think they change themselves, just selectively choose which parts of themselves to show/express
