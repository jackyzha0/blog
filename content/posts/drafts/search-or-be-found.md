the search box versus the feed
intentional browsing vs being served by an algorithm

"I realized that the experience of research is exactly opposite to the way I usually often encounter information online. When you research a subject, you make a series of important decisions, not least what it is you want to research, and you make a commitment to spend time finding information that doesn’t immediately present itself. You seek out different sources that you understand may be biased for various reasons. The very structure of the library… allows for browsing and close attention. Nothing could be more different from the news feed, where these aspects of information—provenance, trustworthiness, or what the hell it’s even about—are neither internally coherent nor subject to my judgment. Instead this information throws itself at me in no particular order, auto-playing videos and grabbing me with headlines. And behind the scenes, it’s me who’s being researched."

transition from aggregator of information to oracle
pagerank -> rank literally whats relevant, asks the user to determine what info they wanna actually use
oracle -> tells you the 'right' answer

"The idea is that instead of searching for information in a vast list of web pages, users would ask questions and have a language model trained on those pages answer them directly. The approach could change not only how search engines work, but what they do—and how we interact with them"

epistemological question
Metzler and his colleagues are interested in a search engine that behaves like a human expert. It should produce answers in natural language, synthesized from more than one document, and back up its answers with references to supporting evidence, as Wikipedia articles aim to do.


does language dictate how we think about the world?
importance of vocabulary
do we need labels to discuss things
false dichotomies
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is true -- but the effects are far more pronounced for programming languages than for spoken languages.

The language you write code in ends up shaping huge parts of you worldview even when you're not programming
The best purpose of language in general, and programming languages in particular is to expand the domain of thinkable thoughts
The power of programming languages (and why you may want to learn them, even if not intent on building software) is that they let you get you hands dirty with building and using ur own abstractions.
