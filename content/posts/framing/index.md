Two bits I've been thinking about a lot (and briefly touched on in issue [#3](https://buttondown.email/jacky/archive/spider-man-neurons-hearing-fractals-and-fulfilment) and [#4](https://buttondown.email/jacky/archive/sun-sneezing-infrastructure-moderation-and-why) of my newsletter) are framing and context collapse 

## What's in the frame

In which Hank talks about the metaphorical ‘frame’, or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what’s actually going on outside the frame. 

Media influencers, <> shape 
In doing so, we think this sculpted normal is how people normally live their lives. Not protraying the whole story.

"I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what’s inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can’t help but believe what’s inside the frame, because it’s literally all we can see"

Hank talks about speech particularities that he cuts out, leading to his signature jump-cut heavy editing study

Have this identity that we portray in certain scenarios and it feels *weird* to deviate from it.
Once you share something, you can't unshare it, internet feels intractable

If all we ever see are other people’s frames, how do we remind ourselves of what’s going on outside of it and normalize being ‘out-of-frame’?

Acknowledge that this isn't the complete picture -> there is a frame

## Context Separation
![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](images/context-separation.png)

A big reason we behave differently in different situations is because Behaviour Breeds Behaviour. This means a couple of things. Firstly, if you do something once, it’s easy to do it again. If you smoke once, it’s easy to smoke again. If you fast once, it is easy to fast again. Secondly, if you do something with a person once, it is easy to repeat that behaviour with that person again. If you tell someone a secret and build trust once, you are likely to share more with that person.

Finally, your behaviour could influence the behaviour of the people around you and vice versa. For example, if you hang out with a group of fitness enthusiasts, your own alignment towards fitness is likely to increase. ([alignment](/posts/collaborative-thinking))

For example, even as children, we tailor our responses to situations and incidents based on the behaviour of people around us, just like adults do. I’m sure you’ve seen a toddler running around and playing with his parents. If he suddenly topples over and is not really hurt, he looks around for people’s reactions. If his mother comes running towards him expressing shock and anxiety, the kid starts to cry. If she continues to play the game and brushes the “fall” aside like nothing happened, the kid moves on with life.

## Context Collapse

But when this number goes into the thousands, how do you choose to behave across all these seemingly different environments?

"when your different friend groups are meeting and you need to combine the different personalities you maintain around them"

i think this is super interesting because i see all social media presences are flavors of the "authentic self"
so if you have someone on all of them the common denominator is who they are (limited but true
and the same goes for seeing the same person in different social contexts
what are they like with family, friends, in competition
using that as a guiding point for getting to know people is nice

hmm, maybe not different flavours but different 'frames' or subsets of the same person

i dont think they change themselves, just selectively choose which parts of themselves to show/express

Our interpersonal relationships can be impacted by what we decide to share on social media
why privacy is so important

LinkedIn -> why this seems so foreign and we shit on it
the context is so painfully obvious and has very little overlap with the rest of our

first like on a post determines who the algorithm shows the post too
reinforcing the type of people who are likely to view your content

The "lowest common denominator” strategy, or only making posts that you're comfortable with anybody seeing, staying away from anything controversial or overly personal.
“Social syphentation,” or migrating your conversation to a place where you have a smaller audience, like a group text, Instagram DMs or Snapchat, where the context and audience are clear.
People are also avoiding context collapse by turning to more ephemeral mediums, like Instagram stories and Snapchat. These posts don’t stick around, so you can share without as much worry about the consequences.
Finstas, private content -> selective group of people
