## What's in the frame
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es
In which Hank talks about the metaphorical ‘frame’, or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what’s actually going on outside the frame. 

Media influencers, <> shape 
In doing so, we think this sculpted normal is how people normally live their lives. Not protraying the whole story.

"I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what’s inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can’t help but believe what’s inside the frame, because it’s literally all we can see"

Hank talks about speech particularities that he cuts out, leading to his signature jump-cut heavy editing study

Have this identity that we portray in certain scenarios and it feels *weird* to deviate from it.
Once you share something, you can't unshare it, internet feels intractable

If all we ever see are other people’s frames, how do we remind ourselves of what’s going on outside of it and normalize being ‘out-of-frame’?

Acknowledge that this isn't the complete picture -> there is a frame

## Digital Permanence
episode #172 - ryan schiller: librex and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses 

silencing of ideas
people go to colleges not to just read textbooks
but to talk to professors who've studied it deeply and get their opinions on it
but what happens when those professors feel like their can't express their opinions?
what happens when a student is offended by that opinion and the professor is at risk of losing their job?

## cancel culture and healthy debate
i think being inclusive and mindful of the opinions is really important
but there also needs to be a balance between the weight of creating an unsafe place for ideas vs unsafe places for people

where we're trying to communicate in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn't result in the silencing of voices

"don't make sweeping statements against core identity groups"
core identity groups -> race, religion, sex, gender, nationality, etc.

should ideas be treated as separate from the people who proposed them?
logically, ideas should be evaluated from the merit of the idea itself
yet, there are cases when other contextual information is important
* e.g., when talking about diversity issues, talking from first-hand exp is often a lot more valid than second-hand or third-hand
* in these cases, does methodology and original source of speaker count as *part* of the idea?

"The word “axiom” means self evident truth. All of mathematics are models based on frameworks of axioms and postulates. We develop proofs and theorems from these. All facts and axioms in mathematics are fundamentally flawed. Take a look at Gödel's incompleteness theorem. It basically states that if math is consistent, it cannot be complete. And if it is not complete, it must not be consistent."

are ideas inherently different from facts?
what are the universal axioms of the universe?
descartes
* solipsism -> we can only know that we exist


anonymity

"61% of students on Ivy League campuses are afraid to speak their minds because of campus culture"

difference between public and private selves
* friedman chooses to minimize this difference as much as possible
* extra mental effort to separate the two, need to remember what parts of yourself to portray to what people


i think for me from an engineering perspective like if i'm dishonest with others i will too quickly become dishonest with myself and in so doing i will not truly be able to think deeply about the world and come up and build revolutionary ideas there's something about honesty that feels like it's that first principles thinking

* being scared to be completely vulnerable and honest

* changing frame of life
  people change over time, yet the internet doesn't feel super accepting of these changes
  your opinions 10 years ago can still be critiqued as if you hold them today
  should normalize growth
  if people STILL hold views that are problematic by today's standards, then THAT's problematic
  
  move towards realtime media rather than offline media (e.g. streaming > videos)

A theorem is only a fact in the context of the axioms on which it is based. Axioms are treated more like postulates, accepted only tentatively and defining a branch of mathematics.
All facts and axioms in mathematics are fundamentally flawed. Take a look at Gödel's incompleteness theorem. It basically states that if math is consistent, it cannot be complete. And if it is not complete, it must not be consistent.
The uncertainty principle governs what we can call facts in all systems. Including mathematics.
It more or less says that you can only explain a system using criteria defined in that system.

## Context Collapse

https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/

i think this is super interesting because i see all social media presences are flavors of the "authentic self"
so if you have someone on all of them the common denominator is who they are (limitd=ed but true0
and the same goes for seeing the same person in different social contexts
what are they like with family, friends, in competiiont
using that as a guiding point for getting to know people is nice

hmm, maybe not different flavours but different 'frames' or subsets of the same person

i dont think they change themselves, just selectively choose which parts of themselves to show/express
