## A year of 'almosts'
2020 is:
* about 9.5 times longer than a Rick Roll in seconds
* about 54 times longer than the number of minutes I listened to Spotify this year
* about how many contributions I made on GitHub this year
* roughly the amount of pages I've read this year
* almost a palindrome

Now there's nothing super fascinating about almost-palindromes but it is also very fitting given the number of 'almosts' in my year. Here's an imperfect recollection of what I've been up to this year.

### nwPlus
I help to do event logistics at nwPlus! This year, Allison and Anne somehow convinced me to take on a director role for HackCamp (or what was previously known as UBC Local Hack Day). 

To be completely frank, I had no clue what that really entailed and jumped into it head-first. Along the way, I struggled with figuring out how to effectively lead a team of 4 older teammates, balancing nwPlus with all my other commitments, and being confident in my work. We had a bunch of logistical wrenches thrown our way, from figuring out how to bring our hackathon to the virtual stage to an entire event rebrand. It was honestly amazing to have even been able to hold the event at all, let alone attract over 900+ registrations, 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ livestream viewers, and $1200 in donations to charities. To say I was completely blown away would be an understatement. We didn't get to hold the in-person event we were hoping for, but the next-best thing was almost just as good.

### A poorly played game of Tetris
Due to a combination of poor planning, luck, and FOMO, I made the poor decision to take on an internship at Hootsuite along with the open-source fellowship at MLH, all the while trying to juggle my mental sanity and health. Spoiler alert: it was a bad idea.

was not good in terms of mental health
had to develop healthier versions of dealing with stress and anxiety

learned lots
### Independent living
Moved out from on-campus housing into my own place!
loneliness during pandemic but i've learned to make do
fill the silence with music, podcasts, or the occasional youtube rabbit hole
cooking

## An imperfect retrospective
It would be sort of naive to try to 
Too much happened this year that I can fully reflect on

### Things that sparked joy
  - surround yourself with people who care
  - Heraclitus said, “No man steps in the same river twice.” The second time around, both man and river are different than they were before. The books are the same, but we change between reads. The world changes, too.
  - exercise, nature, reading, art
### Things that didn't spark to joy
  - learn to block out time better
  - balance of intake/output

## Goal setting
setting goals not to achieve a number but rather to continue a task
- reversal theory -> means-ends domain
  - telic action -> serious minded
      - motivated by achievement/future goals
      - e.g. reading to hit a goal
      - means to an end
  - paratelic action -> playful
      - enjoyment of the process in the moment
      - e.g. reading to actually read/learn
      - the actual end
### Paratelic Goals
- Acknowledging privilege and use it to help those who are less fortunate
- Have impact with my work, whether that be through writing, projects, or just conversations
- Lead a more physically healthy lifestyle
- Learn more about the woorld through a feedback loop of reading, writing, and talking to people

### Telic Goals
- Donate 5% of pre-tax income to charity
- Reach 50k people through projects and blog posts
- Read 10 books
- Set aside 10 hours a week for personal projects, learning, and writing
- Run from my apartment to Stanley Park and back (~10km) in one go
- Meet 100 new people in 2021, being more comfortable talking to people

I've been waiting almost 2 years to say this pun but,
