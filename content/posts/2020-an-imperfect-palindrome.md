# In reflection

- things that went well
  - surround yourself with people who care
  - Heraclitus said, “No man steps in the same river twice.” The second time around, both man and river are different than they were before. The books are the same, but we change between reads. The world changes, too.
  - exercise, nature, reading
- things to work on
  - learn to block out time better
  - balance of intake/output

# Goals
- donating 5% of pre-tax income to charity
- read x books
- write x posts
- set aside x% of time for personal projects and learning
- run the length from my apartment to stanley park and back (~10km) in one go
- meeting more people → meet 100 new people in 2021, being more comfortable talking to people
