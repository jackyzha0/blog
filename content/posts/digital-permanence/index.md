Once you share something, you can't unshare it, internet feels intractable

episode #172 - ryan schiller: librex and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses

silencing of ideas
people go to colleges not to just read textbooks
but to talk to professors who've studied it deeply and get their opinions on it
but what happens when those professors feel like their can't express their opinions?
what happens when a student is offended by that opinion and the professor is at risk of losing their job?

## cancel culture and healthy debate
i think being inclusive and mindful of the opinions is really important
but there also needs to be a balance between the weight of creating an unsafe place for ideas vs unsafe places for people

where we're trying to communicate in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn't result in the silencing of voices

"don't make sweeping statements against core identity groups"
core identity groups -> race, religion, sex, gender, nationality, etc.

should ideas be treated as separate from the people who proposed them?
logically, ideas should be evaluated from the merit of the idea itself
yet, there are cases when other contextual information is important
* e.g., when talking about diversity issues, talking from first-hand exp is often a lot more valid than second-hand or third-hand
* in these cases, does methodology and original source of speaker count as *part* of the idea?

"The word “axiom” means self evident truth. All of mathematics are models based on frameworks of axioms and postulates. We develop proofs and theorems from these. All facts and axioms in mathematics are fundamentally flawed. Take a look at Gödel's incompleteness theorem. It basically states that if math is consistent, it cannot be complete. And if it is not complete, it must not be consistent."

are ideas inherently different from facts?
what are the universal axioms of the universe?
descartes
* solipsism -> we can only know that we exist


anonymity

"61% of students on Ivy League campuses are afraid to speak their minds because of campus culture"

difference between public and private selves
* friedman chooses to minimize this difference as much as possible
* extra mental effort to separate the two, need to remember what parts of yourself to portray to what people


i think for me from an engineering perspective like if i'm dishonest with others i will too quickly become dishonest with myself and in so doing i will not truly be able to think deeply about the world and come up and build revolutionary ideas there's something about honesty that feels like it's that first principles thinking

* being scared to be completely vulnerable and honest

* changing frame of life
  people change over time, yet the internet doesn't feel super accepting of these changes
  your opinions 10 years ago can still be critiqued as if you hold them today
  should normalize growth
  if people STILL hold views that are problematic by today's standards, then THAT's problematic

  move towards realtime media rather than offline media (e.g. streaming > videos)

A theorem is only a fact in the context of the axioms on which it is based. Axioms are treated more like postulates, accepted only tentatively and defining a branch of mathematics.
All facts and axioms in mathematics are fundamentally flawed. Take a look at Gödel's incompleteness theorem. It basically states that if math is consistent, it cannot be complete. And if it is not complete, it must not be consistent.
The uncertainty principle governs what we can call facts in all systems. Including mathematics.
It more or less says that you can only explain a system using criteria defined in that system.
