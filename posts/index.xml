A (not so) brief exploration of how we tackle classifying intents in reflect. Part 1 will touch on defining the problem we’re trying to solve, the data we have, and how we pre-processed it. Part 2 will focus on the architecture of the model we built, how well it does, and thoughts on improving it for the future.
The problem Classifying intents is at the core of reflect.</description></item><item><title>reflect: NLP model explained pt.2</title><link>https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/reflect-nlp-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 08:51:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/reflect-nlp-2/</guid><description>How do we tell that this is a “valid” intent?
In this second part, we’ll take a deep dive into the neural network that helps us solve this hefty problem of classifying whether an intent is valid or not.
Recall that in part 1, we went over the data we had, and how we could prepare that data to feed into our neural network. Now that we have all our data ready and prepped, let’s talk about the model!</description></item><item><title>Life of a High School Software Developer at Hootsuite</title><link>https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/hootsuite-hs-intern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2019 08:51:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/hootsuite-hs-intern/</guid><description>(with insights from Calvin and Hobbes)
Since I’ve started at Hootsuite, I have
added and/or changed 6223 lines of code in 16 different repos
closed 24 tickets
made 4 new Slack emotes
listened to almost 10,000 minutes of lofi

Including the amount of money I’ve spent on lunch this past summer, everything has been so much more than I expected it to be.</description></item></channel></rss>
