Rather, I feel like I’m only portraying a subset or a <em>frame</em> of myself.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing either.</p><h2 id=whats-not-in-the-frame>What&rsquo;s (not) in the frame</h2><p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es">vlogbrothers video from March</a>, John talks about the metaphorical frame or context in which people present themselves. We tailor and adjust our behaviour depending on the environment we’re in, or the audience we find ourselves in front of. However, in doing so, we inadvertently portray an incomplete picture &ndash; we frame only the parts we want them to see.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what’s inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can’t help but believe what’s inside the frame, because it’s literally all we can see&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>An unfortunate side effect of this is that it starts setting expectations for the audience as to how we ‘normally’ behave. This ‘audience’ of people can be friends, followers, or strangers. They are a group of people that pay attention to what <em>you</em> have to say because of your thoughts, opinions, and general persona. What happens when we change?</p><p>If we&rsquo;re expected to keep growing as people, these thoughts and opinions will obviously change over time. So why does it feel so <em>weird</em> to deviate from these set identities that we’ve become used to portraying in certain scenarios?</p><h2 id=context-separation>Context Separation</h2><p><img src=images/context-separation.png alt="Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames"></p><p>In order to answer that question, let us make a brief foray into the realm of psychology. Why do humans tend to act differently in different environments? I think two key aspects of behaviour play a role here:</p><h3 id=behaviour-is-sticky>Behaviour is sticky</h3><p>It is easier to travel along a path well-travelled than one covered in weeds and bush &ndash; if you do something once, it becomes easier to do it again. Similarly, doing something with a person once means it becomes easier to repeat that same behaviour with the person again. If I always have a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, I’m likely to do so for every foreseeable breakfast in the future. If I trust you enough to tell you a secret, I’m likely to share more with you in the future.</p><p>In some ways, this is Newton&rsquo;s First Law but applied to behaviour: if you do something one way, you are likely to keep doing things in that way unless encouraged to do otherwise.</p><h3 id=individuals-tend-to-conform-to-group-norms>Individuals tend to conform to group norms</h3><p>In 1951, Solomon Asch conducted <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments>an experiment</a> to investigate the extent of which social pressures can affect a person’s behaviour. In this experiment, he asked, &ldquo;Which line is the longest out of the three given?". In an individual setting, 99% of people answered correctly. However, when put in a room of actors instructed to answer incorrectly, nearly 75% of all participants gave at least one incorrect answer throughout 12 trials.</p><p>People conform for two main reasons:</p><ol><li>They want to fit in with the group <strong>(normative influence)</strong></li><li>They believe the group is better informed than they are <strong>(informational influence)</strong></li></ol><p>Historically, having different behaviours in different contexts may have been evolutionarily beneficial, helping us to better collaborate and form connections with each other without causing undue conflict.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;For your ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion, but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded. Being together meant survival, being alone meant death.&rdquo; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA">Kurzgesagt</a></p></blockquote><p>Even as children, when we get hurt, we look to authority figures around us to see how to react. If our mother comes to us expressing worry and concern, we cry. If everyone around us continues to play as if everything is normal, we will brush aside the injury and continue to play with the group.</p><p>Our ability to ‘frame’ ourselves different depending on the social situation likely stemmed from this behaviour too.</p><h2 id=context-collapse>Context Collapse</h2><p><img src=images/context-collapse.png alt="Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames"></p><p>Facebook friends. Twitter followers. LinkedIn connections. All of these social media apps seem to have the same purpose: to communicate and connect. On Facebook, I mostly use it to stay updated with friends and to tag people in memes. On Twitter, my online presence is a mixture of brain dumps, ML papers, and the occasional shitpost. I reserve LinkedIn for promotion and ‘business-y’ content. Why do we behave differently from platform to platform?</p><p>The content I throw on Twitter is not something I would readily post on LinkedIn. To an extent, my social presence across these platforms is <em>incongruent</em>. The core tenet is that different apps curate different types of communities and thus social contexts. As a result, we try to separate these contexts in the best way we know how to: by acting differently.</p><p>But, something keeps pulling us to be active on all these platforms: we fear missing out. Despite how terrible apps like Instagram makes most people feel, we find ourselves gravitating to them again and again to find out what our old friend from highschool is doing now.</p><p>This pressure to keep posted with everything and everyone is what keeps people chained to these different platforms. As a result, everyone keeps track of each other on every platform possible. The <em>overlap</em> in target audience between these apps then becomes very large and all of these different social contexts ‘collapse’ and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain these separate personalities.</p><p>This feeling of trying to talk to everyone at once is called <a href=https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/>context collapse</a>. This phenomenon is not exclusive to digital spaces (think large gatherings like graduation or weddings), but the permeability of these digital spaces means that the frequency at which this happens is vastly increased.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;when your different friend groups are meeting and you need to combine the different personalities you maintain around them&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>When experiencing context collapse, talking to anyone becomes very difficult. Smaller groups, by nature, have more commonalities to talk about, whether that be interests, music taste, place of study, or shared goals. In the massive groups that form when we experience context collapse, the amount of overlap between anyone is miniscule. How are you supposed to have any sort of meaningful connection when the only thing you share in common on the platform is that you ‘know’ each other?</p><h2 id=centrifuging-contexts>Centrifuging Contexts</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed three main ways people are tackling context collapse (whether consciously or subconsciously).</p><ol><li><p><strong>Lowest Common Denominator</strong>. Only making posts that anybody will be able to understand and relate to, staying away from controversial or overly personal topics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fragmentation</strong>. Purposefully having conversations in places where your audience is smaller, like group chats, direct messages, or small closed communities. In these cases, the specific context and audience is well-defined. More users are also turning to ‘finstas’ which are accounts focused for a closed group of friends and family rather than the entire public internet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Realtime</strong>. Platforms and individuals are leaning more towards ephemeral content, like stories or streaming. Because this content is intended to be viewed live, the effective audience is much smaller.</p></li></ol><h2 id=social-bandwidth>Social bandwidth</h2><p>I think in part, this is why nobody has been successful in creating a single social network to replace all of the existing apps. As humans, we want the ability to closely connect with people, and context collapses makes that exceedingly difficult. We have limited social bandwidth &ndash; there&rsquo;s only so much attention we can give to everyone. By increasing the breadth of our audience, we reduce the depth at which we can communicate with each individual. As app developers rush to combine all of these platforms into one, maybe we should step back and think whether this is really necessary.</p><p>On these larger social media apps where I&rsquo;m &lsquo;connected&rsquo; to hundreds of people, I don&rsquo;t feel like I can have very insightful conversations or thoughts. Those conversations almost exclusively happen in communities like <a href=http://nwplus.io/>nwPlus</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/reboot_hq/>reboot</a> where there is enough alignment of values and interests that we can scrape past the surface level chit chat and get to really exploring ideas and knowing people.</p><p>We should have platforms and communities that allow us to explore and break some of these surface-level generalizations of identities that we&rsquo;ve pigeonholed ourselves into. Give individuals the freedom to change ideas and identities over time and don&rsquo;t force them to try to cater to <em>everyone</em> at the same time.</p><p>Different social contexts call for different social behaviours, and that&rsquo;s ok.</p></div><div><hr><div class=morePosts><a class="postLink next" href="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/ctrlv-next/?ref=footer">Rewriting ctrl-v using Next.js →</a></div><article><p>I'm always happy to have follow up conversations or hear your thoughts!
